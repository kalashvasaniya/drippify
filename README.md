This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Password Protection

This app is gated behind a simple password screen using middleware and a cookie.

- Set environment variables `SITE_PASSWORD1` and/or `SITE_PASSWORD2` in `.env.local`.
- Backwards compatible: `SITE_PASSWORD` still works if present.
- Users are redirected to `/password` until they submit a valid password.
- On success, a cookie `site_access_granted=true` is set for 7 days.

Example `.env.local`:

```
SITE_PASSWORD1=first-secret
SITE_PASSWORD2=second-secret
# Optional legacy single password
# SITE_PASSWORD=legacy-secret
```
